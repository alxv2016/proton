# Kinetic Design Experiments
This is a series of SVG animation experiments conducted using the GSAP library to animate SVG illustrations. Warning: may use significant CPU resouces if viewed for an extended period.

## Demo
You can view the demo here:
[Proton Energy](https://proton.alxvtoronto.com/)

## Take aways
1. Using GSAP animation the "Angular way"
2. Dynamically animating SVG layers

## Libraries used
To keep it lean only a handful of external libraries were used
1. GSAP - [gsap](https://greensock.com/gsap/)
2. Angular - [angular](https://angular.io/)

## Dev and Build scripts
```
ng serve
```
```
ng build --prod
```

Created by Alex Vong (me), this project was built with passion and was used as base of refreshing my angular dev knowledge.
